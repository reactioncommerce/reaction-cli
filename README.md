## Development

**Install**

```sh
git clone https://github.com/jussivesa/reaction-cli.git

cd reaction-cli

yarn
```

**Developing**

To start a live reloading watcher that recompiles the code on file changes:

```sh
yarn run watch
```

Keep in mind that if you previously installed `reaction-cli` from npm, you will need to uninstall it before that command will work.  This is because it runs `npm link` every time and that adds a symlink to the executable that goes in the same place as the npm install (which will throw an error).
