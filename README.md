# reaction-cli

## Deprecated as of Reaction 2.0

In Reaction 2.0 we no longer use the `reaction-cli` npm package. Key bits of this project have been incorporated directly back into the [reactioncommerce/reaction](https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction) repository.

We don't anticipate further updates to this package. Please file new feature requests in the [Reaction Feature Requests](https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction-feature-requests) repository.

## Overview
A command line tool for [Reaction Commerce](https://reactioncommerce.com)

## Development

**Install**

```sh
git clone https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction-cli.git

cd reaction-cli

yarn
```

**Developing**

To start a live reloading watcher that recompiles the code on file changes:

```sh
yarn run watch
```

Keep in mind that if you previously installed `reaction-cli` from npm, you will need to uninstall it before that command will work.  This is because it runs `npm link` every time and that adds a symlink to the executable that goes in the same place as the npm install (which will throw an error).

**Testing a pull request locally**

If there's a pull request with a branch you want to manually test, follow these steps.

- Clone the fork
  - `git clone git@github.com:some-user/reaction-cli.git`
  - `cd reaction-cli`
- Check out their feature branch if necessary
  - `git checkout some-branch`
- Prepare the build
  - `npm install`
  - `npm run build`
  - `chmod 755 dist/main.js`
- Test in docker
  - `cd` into your local `reaction` directory
  - `docker-compose run --rm --volume ~/reaction-cli/dist/main.js:/usr/local/bin/reaction --publish 9229:9229 --publish 3000:3000 reaction`
    - Adjust your path to the `reaction-cli` working directory as needed to match your local filesystem

**Releasing**

- checkout a branch for your release
- Run `npm version` with the appropriate semver release level
  - This will also create a tag, and circleci will publish to npm based on that tag
- commit the new version
- Push your branch to github and open a pull request
- After your PR is merged, circleci should publish to npm
